I was born in Nineteen Eighty-Four in <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/nSMod2f3PkkTnPJz9'>Bayat</a>, 
a remote town in central Turkey. I developed an interest in science and nature at an early age by 
where my first encounter with science was through the <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37507564-junior-larousse'><em>Junior Larousse</em></a> children's encyclopedias, and my interest in nature stems from being part of a remote, society 
where being self-sufficient was a vital necessity.

I studied BSc and MSc degrees at <a href='https://eee.metu.edu.tr/'>EEE at METU</a>, specialized in <em>image processing</em>, 
<em>machine learning</em> and <em>software development</em>. I worked as aa R&D engineer at TUBITAK, and Roketsan,
and software engineer at Nokta, Amazon, and TomTom. Currently, I am working at Booking.com as software development engineer.
I code mostly in C++, Java and Javascript as a professional, however, I do amateurly some Pyhton, R, Dart, PHP and Kotlin 
whenever I need in my personal projects. I try to solve programming puzzles and join competitive programming whenever I have time, 
and I follow the trends in machine learning and cloud computing.

I ike spending time with my family and friends. Reading and listenin music are my daily, hiking and travelling are my
long-term activities.
